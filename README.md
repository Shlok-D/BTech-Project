Dataset consists of the Hindi Language Case Study Dataset, the English and Marathi Monolingual Summarization Dataset and the Cross Summarization Dataset, all from the Cross Sum Dataset.

English & Marathi Summarization consist of the code for fine-tuning the 6 models selected.

Evaluation Metric consists of the code for the creation of the Relevance Dataset and model training and evaluation and also complete code of Evaluation Metric with Concept Coverage and Semantic Similarity and its subsequent testing.

Hindi Case Study consists of the fine-tuning and evaluation of mbart-50 model on the Hindi language dataset.

LLM Evaluation consists of the code for evaluating GPT, mt0 and Gemini.

Evaluations Code consists of code used to get the Metric scores for the monolingual summarization models and the cross lingual approaches.

These are all one iterations of the basic code of the project, and all the observations were noted down by multiple reruns and experimentation.
