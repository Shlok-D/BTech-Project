It said the move represented the \"finalising\" of new management structures and the merging of its store support centre teams and were part of cost savings already announced. Since March 2019, Sainsbury\\'s has axed one in five senior leadership roles. Last year, it also announced an overhaul of the business aimed at saving £500m, including plans to move up to 70 Argos shops within its business. Sainsbury\\'s employs 178,000 people in total. In Tuesday\\'s update, it refused to say how many management roles in total would be axed. Cost cutting Sainsbury\\'s chief executive Mike Coupe said: \"We have to adapt to continue to meet the needs of our customers now and in the future and, while change can be hard, it\\'s also necessary.\" A spokeswoman said the planned management cuts were part of efforts by the supermarket to try to avoid duplication of roles between Sainsbury\\'s and Argos. Sainsbury\\'s outlined a new strategy in September after its failed Asda merger bid. The plan focused on cost cutting, paying off debt, more technology and further integration with Argos, which it purchased in 2016. Earlier this month Sainsbury\\'s said Christmas sales had fallen despite solid grocery sales after people bought fewer toys. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said the job cuts could have an adverse impact on how the business operates. \"Retailing is a people business,\" he said. \"Stripping out people without any impact on the business [and the customer experience] is difficult.\" He said retail was a tough market which was forcing some chains to prioritise lowering costs over investing, adding that \"retail winners\" are those prepared to make investments to improve revenue.'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\ndf_val_final_mar=pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/english-summarization-dataset/val_final_eng.csv\")\ndf_val_final_mar['text'][0]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-17T09:24:52.660663Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-17T09:24:52.661524Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-17T09:24:52.992556Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-17T09:24:52.661489Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-17T09:24:52.991613Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"execution_count":4,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'Sterling dipped 1.1% to $1.2242 and €1.1004 respectively. The currency could fall further, according to analysts at ING Group, as traders appear to have been betting on a last-minute deal being reached. Many business lobby groups have asked that no-deal be withdrawn as an option to keep investment flowing into the UK. The pound dropped after \"the events over the weekend, where the current stance of the new government became clear\", said Petr Krpata, a currency strategist at ING Group. Michael Gove, who is in charge of planning for no-deal, has said the UK government is currently \"working on the assumption\" of that very outcome. He said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels, but writing in the Sunday Times, he added: \"No deal is now a very real prospect.\" Mr Krpata says ING Group\\'s assumption is that an early election will take place and that the pound will sink as low as €1.05 and $1.18. The last low for sterling was $1.2049, reached in January 2017. The record low was $1.0545 from March 1985, just before G7 powers acted to constrain a particularly strong US currency. Sterling suffered today, at the worst possible time for holidaymakers, as the probability of leaving the EU without a deal rises. It dropped to its lowest level versus the dollar since the Article 50 process began in March 2017, just about staying above $1.22. It reached a two-year low versus the euro of below €1.10. The weakness is now broad based - there was also a fall against the Yen. It is now a trend, down between 6% and 9% against the major currencies since the beginning of May. This will mean rising consumer prices. The rough rule of thumb would see this 6% trade-weighted fall add about 1 percentage point to inflation, enough to complicate the decisions of the Bank of England over interest rates. In theory, a lower pound helps some exporters and, for example, the domestic UK tourism industry. But so much of our manufacturing base needs to import components in order to make those exports, that this effect has not been strong in the years following the significant pound devaluation after the 2016 Brexit vote. Currencies fluctuate, of course, but the path for the pound has been firmly down, as markets start to calculate that the odds on No Deal are far closer to evens than, as the PM has suggested, \"a million to one\". The pound\\'s performance against the dollar During a visit to Scotland, Mr Johnson said the existing withdrawal agreement negotiated with European leaders was \"dead\" and had \"got to go\". EU member nations have said renegotiating the deal is not an option. Today\\'s prices mean even fewer euros and dollars at the bureau de change for holidaymakers. At the Post Office, £1 buys €1.0817 or $1.2041, according to its website. The pound\\'s performance against the euro Separately, UK government debt prices gained as traders bet on a higher chance that interest rates will be cut. The country\\'s 10-year bonds, considered the benchmark, are changing hands for a price that yields as low as 0.627%, the lowest in nearly three years. This implies that the cost of borrowing for the government has fallen.'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from huggingface_hub import notebook_login\nnotebook_login()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-17T09:24:56.496440Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-17T09:24:56.497412Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-17T09:24:56.754245Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-17T09:24:56.497378Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-17T09:24:56.753306Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"VBox(children=(HTML(value='<center> <img\\nsrc=https://huggingface.co/front/assets/huggingface_logo-noborder.sv…","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"57a70c7096104e279af838642d3a16fc"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install datasets==2.15","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-17T09:25:23.071125Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-17T09:25:23.071605Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-17T09:25:38.770719Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-17T09:25:23.071575Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-17T09:25:38.769569Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Collecting datasets==2.15\n  Downloading datasets-2.15.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (20 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (1.26.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyarrow>=8.0.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (11.0.0)\nCollecting pyarrow-hotfix (from datasets==2.15)\n  Downloading pyarrow_hotfix-0.6-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (3.6 kB)\nCollecting dill<0.3.8,>=0.3.0 (from datasets==2.15)\n  Downloading dill-0.3.7-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (9.9 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: pandas in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (2.1.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: requests>=2.19.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (2.31.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: tqdm>=4.62.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (4.66.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: xxhash in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (3.4.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: multiprocess in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (0.70.16)\nCollecting fsspec<=2023.10.0,>=2023.1.0 (from fsspec[http]<=2023.10.0,>=2023.1.0->datasets==2.15)\n  Downloading fsspec-2023.10.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (6.8 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: aiohttp in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (3.9.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: huggingface-hub>=0.18.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (0.20.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: packaging in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (21.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyyaml>=5.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from datasets==2.15) (6.0.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: attrs>=17.3.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from aiohttp->datasets==2.15) (23.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: multidict<7.0,>=4.5 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from aiohttp->datasets==2.15) (6.0.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: yarl<2.0,>=1.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from aiohttp->datasets==2.15) (1.9.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: frozenlist>=1.1.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from aiohttp->datasets==2.15) (1.4.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: aiosignal>=1.1.2 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from aiohttp->datasets==2.15) (1.3.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: async-timeout<5.0,>=4.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from aiohttp->datasets==2.15) (4.0.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: filelock in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from huggingface-hub>=0.18.0->datasets==2.15) (3.13.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=3.7.4.3 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from huggingface-hub>=0.18.0->datasets==2.15) (4.9.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyparsing!=3.0.5,>=2.0.2 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from packaging->datasets==2.15) (3.1.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from requests>=2.19.0->datasets==2.15) (3.3.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from requests>=2.19.0->datasets==2.15) (3.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from requests>=2.19.0->datasets==2.15) (1.26.18)\nRequirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from requests>=2.19.0->datasets==2.15) (2024.2.2)\nINFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of multiprocess to determine which version is compatible with other requirements.

'The chain said the cuts were largely due to its integration of Argos - which it bought in 2016 - into the business. It said the move represented the \"finalising\" of new management structures and the merging of its store support centre teams and were part of cost savings already announced. Since March 2019, Sainsbury\\'s has axed one in five senior leadership roles. Last year, it also announced an overhaul of the business aimed at saving £500m, including plans to move up to 70 Argos shops within its business. Sainsbury\\'s employs 178,000 people in total. In Tuesday\\'s update, it refused to say how many management roles in total would be axed. Cost cutting Sainsbury\\'s chief executive Mike Coupe said: \"We have to adapt to continue to meet the needs of our customers now and in the future and, while change can be hard, it\\'s also necessary.\" A spokeswoman said the planned management cuts were part of efforts by the supermarket to try to avoid duplication of roles between Sainsbury\\'s and Argos. Sainsbury\\'s outlined a new strategy in September after its failed Asda merger bid. The plan focused on cost cutting, paying off debt, more technology and further integration with Argos, which it purchased in 2016. Earlier this month Sainsbury\\'s said Christmas sales had fallen despite solid grocery sales after people bought fewer toys. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said the job cuts could have an adverse impact on how the business operates. \"Retailing is a people business,\" he said. \"Stripping out people without any impact on the business [and the customer experience] is difficult.\" He said retail was a tough market which was forcing some chains to prioritise lowering costs over investing, adding that \"retail winners\" are those prepared to make investments to improve revenue.', 'summary': \"Sainsbury's has announced plans to cut hundreds of management roles in a fresh round of job cuts at the supermarket.\"}\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset_2 =
