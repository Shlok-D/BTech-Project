I have always made a decision. A 30-year-old girl living in Scotland told BBC about talking to Scotland in the 'The Nine' program. He said, “I knew I was going to get married. When I remember it, I am very happy. In the western culture, I feel like my parents are so angry. “We’re going to get away from western culture.” There was a lot of mosquitoes in the family. The environment of the house was working. I was free of mind: I was free of mind. I wanted a lot of life. It is not yet forgotten to remember the 17th year of visiting Pakistan. He said, “They started to say that you’ve done sin. You will have to marry your brother. You have found your family’s reputation. You may not be able to get married, but you may not be able to get married in the morning.” The households were under pressure. They listened to the households for refuge. “I thought the house was quiet. They wanted me to be like that. Mind and mind are heard. I think it’s hard to say,” he said. He left the house and returned to Scotland alone after five weeks in Pakistan. Their husband would come in a few days. After a few months, he left his house and went to the house of his friend. He said, “I took the stuff and took it out. It was a year away from the house. The people of the house, the people of the house, and the people of the community have made a lot of excitement.” I started to make a strange tick on my way. You will not be able to see your brother and sister, and you will not be able to see them. Everything that has happened to you has happened to you. The independent Muslim woman returned home a year later. At that time, the mentality was completely collapsing. But surprisingly, their families did it. But the community denied them. It was unfortunate, but we did it. We gave love priority to religion. After that, it was a breakthrough. He went to the University of Abbott for further education. From then on, I am an independent Muslim woman. Marriage is a criminal offence for any man. It is a legal offence to marry a physical person who is a legal offence to marry. According to the UK government, 1,764 cases of marriage have occurred last year. In 2017 there were 18 cases of forced marriage in Scotland. Last year, the rate increased to 30. The right to marry a person is a criminal offence that the citizens are not aware of by the British government’s department that investigates the crimes. We have not been able to resolve the question of marriage. Education and awareness are a decisive role in two things. The girl must be married to someone with whom she is suffering. They don’t imagine how much mental and physical it is to get married by the girl. Do you read this? (You can follow us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter to get all the updates of the BBC.
